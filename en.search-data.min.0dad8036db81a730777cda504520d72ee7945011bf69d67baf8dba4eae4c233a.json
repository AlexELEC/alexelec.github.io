[{"id":0,"href":"/docs/tvlink/docs/overview/","title":"Overview","section":"TVLINK","content":" General info # «TVLINK Server» is a repeater and aggregator of IPTV channels with a user-friendly web interface. It retransmits streams specified by the user from sources such as: IPTV playlists, Acestream, Ministra/Stаlker Middleware or add-ons.\nThe main goal of the program is to provide uninterrupted operation of IPTV channels. You can automatically or manually combine streams of the same channel from different sources, and «TVLINK», depending on the priority of the source and its operability, will select and retransmit the best stream.\nIf for some reason the previous stream stops broadcasting, the program will automatically switch to the next stream of that channel. This cycle will continue as long as at least one stream from the set is working.\nThe program supports IPTV archives (catchup) with the ability to switch to the next stream, even if the archive types in these streams differ. Any IPTV player with support for the «Shift» archive type is suitable for this function. Even if such a player does not support other archive types (Append, Flussonic), it will still play them thanks to the internal conversion of archive types in «TVLINK».\nThe program also provides:\nconvenient setup and delivery of EPG (electronic program guide in XMLTV format) built-in API for independently writing add-ons unlimited number of users and IPTV sources (depends only on hardware capabilities) ability (using profiles) to provide different channel sets to different users edit (rename, disable, delete) channels and groups (individually or in groups) sort, set numbers for channels and groups, set icons for channels ability to automatically (on a schedule) update channel sources and EPG protection of your channels from unauthorized access using «tokens» stream status and program operation log in the web interface The program uses the Python module «Streamlink». This, in turn, makes it possible to use a large number of add-ons for «Streamlink» itself (those that do not require the support of the «webbrowser» submodule). For example, watch live broadcasts of TV channels from YouTube and many other sources.\n«TVLINK» can be used with any IPTV player, but to get all the benefits of the server, you should use «PVR TVLINK Client» for Kodi.\nProgram limitations. The program does not work in the territory of Russia and Belarus. However, if you do not support Russian aggression in Ukraine, create a file named «Glory_to_Ukraine» in the main «TVLINK» directory, for example:\ntouch /opt/tvlink/Glory_to_Ukraine This way, you will disable geolocation checking when the program starts.\n«TVLINK» releases are compiled only for «Linux». The following architectures are supported:\nx86-64 arm7 aarch64 The program does not require many resources. For example, when serving two clients, it occupies an average of 70 MB of RAM.\n"}]
